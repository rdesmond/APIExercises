/**
Method Demonstrations for review purposes that weren't otherwise needed for this application

 - Demonstrate Casting: at least 4 times with different data types

 - Demonstrate Mastery of Flow Control:
    return (at least twice in a single method)
    break (at least once in the same method)
    continue (at least once in the same method)
    in multiple locations throughout a single method

 - Demonstrate the Use of VarArgs
